While we'd all love to just pick our own research with no restrictions or limitations, it's important for the business to gain real value from the deliverables. If you want to do a research project, this page should help you think about where and how your research will provide value, and how to express that value in a research proposal.

Investing in the cost and effort required for a good piece of research is beneficial to growing the business. In return, we can expect greater visibility of our business unit and exposure of our research and ideas outside the company. This also gives us an opportunity to showcase our competence in the key verticals and boost ourselves to an even wider stage.

# The purpose of a research proposal

At its core, a research proposal explains what research you'd like to do, what benefit it provides, how long it will take, and what the deliverables are. This alone is fairly easy to write – you could do it in four short bullet points if you're particularly concise about it – but that doesn't really help the people who have to read it and make decisions about if/when/how your research should be performed.

When writing a research proposal, it is important to think about the needs of the people who help organise, manage, and contribute to your research:

* Your manager;
* Testing team;
* Your colleagues within the technical community;
* Business stakeholders.

It's easy to think of a research proposal as a way to convince people to let you do some research, but realistically they're unlikely to need much convincing – good research is beneficial to everyone. A good research proposal isn't about being as convincing as possible, or promising a lot of cool deliverables; it's about considering who you're presenting that proposal to, and demonstrating to them that you've considered their requirements as well as your own.

# Who benefits from your research?

Aside from your own personal enjoyment, there are three main entities (or groups of entities) that we can show value for:

* Value for us (testing team, IR team, etc);
* Value for [ORGANISATION];
* Value for customers.

Research projects must realistically have value for at least one of these groups.

Value for us is usually related to expansion or improvement of capabilities, for example building a tool for assessing a particular device's configuration, or related to reducing the cost or level of effort required for a particular type of project. This type of value is not necessarily restricted to technical or service improvement work – documentation and other materials to support those new to this type of delivery is also particularly useful.

Value for [ORGANISATION] is generally related to improved market presence, making more sales, expanding into new industry sectors (particularly within the big four verticals: financial tech, IoT, global service providers, and connected vehicles), and other general outreach. We would like to build our relationship with other industry players and establish a reputation for being the go-to people in these sectors.

Value for customers is normally about understanding the value that our customers attach to our services and improving that proposition in an efficient and repeatable way, e.g. if we have a better understanding what our customers are worried about we can offer good practice guides, better targeted advice, or new tooling that speeds up assessments. Furthermore, it can also relate to the commons in a broader sense, e.g. a more secure Internet benefits everyone (our customers included) that uses it.

# Which industry verticals are applicable to your research?

At the moment we are trying to focus on the following industry verticals:

* Financial technology (fintech);
* Telecomms providers (e.g. ISPs, telecoms);
* UK CNI;
* Internet of Things.

Your research may not be attached to any specific vertical, or may not be applicable to these verticals at all; this is fine, but you may gain more support for ambitious research proposals if they are applicable to the above verticals.

# Deliverables

Deliverables are a critical part of research – they're the pieces of work that actually offer value to the team and business. Types of deliverable include:

* Tools and documentation;
* Internal marketing (e.g. internally distributed papers, brown-bags, etc.);
* External marketing (e.g. blog posts, conference talks, etc.);
* Training for the team;
* Client-facing materials (e.g. good practice guides).

This is not an exhaustive list.

Some research will have one deliverable, other research will have many deliverables.

# Research checklist

Go through the following checklist to help justify and contextualise your research for the business.

1. Have you identified any prior research or work, either internally or externally, related to the research you are proposing? This question is critical – research may appear to offer significant value to the business, but if the research was already done by someone else then there's often little point in duplicating effort.
2. Does the outcome of your research project offer significant value to at least one group, as defined above? What is that value?
3. Do you have well-defined deliverables? What are they? When will they be delivered? Who will they be delivered to? How do the deliverables contribute to the types of value you expressed in question 2?
4. What is the cost of the research in terms of time and financial requirements? Are the costs (both money and time) reasonable in terms of cost/benefit and return on investment? Can the research and deliverable production be split across multiple people in a sensible way?
5. Does the research present any undue risk to [ORGANISATION] from a legal standpoint? We're fortunate to have lawyers that understand our approach but even with their support there are still challenges. When conducting research on a third-party product, we need to consider:
  * EU and US laws are not the same so we need to evaluate any contractual obligations in the EULA of the third-party product that is being evaluated (e.g. it could have a provision against benchmark testing);
  * If it's possible, we should try not to lead with the vendor's name – this isn't the case if there is an actual vulnerability but in such cases, there is a clearly defined disclosure process that operates across [ORGANISATION] that we can follow;
  * Check if there is an account team that sells [ORGANISATION] products to the vendor of the third party product being evaluated and actively engage with them – they may know the lie of the land better and it's better to have them as an ally than a foe;
  * If possible, pass it the vendor PSIRT for comment – ensure good will wherever possible;
  * As a fall-back position, we should plan on not naming the vendor and or co-ordinating a joint paper;
  * If there are concerns, pass it through counsel first – they can temper risks if given the opportunity;
  * Remember a common-sense approach - [ORGANISATION] is a large secutity vendor and subject to third-party review thus we need to be objective and factual as that is what we would expect of reviews of [ORGANISATION] products.
6. Are there any other risks? For example, we could do two weeks of vulnerability hunting on a product and get nothing from it. This isn't necessarily a blocker to doing research, but if you can find a way to ensure some kind of deliverable (e.g. write-up of approach, or novel defensive measures you found) even if you don't find lots of juicy bugs then that's a major benefit.

When you've got answers to these questions, it becomes more apparent that the "concise four bullet point"-style research proposals (as mentioned above) aren't really sufficient to demonstrate that you've really thought about the project at anything more than a superficial level (and we've all been guilty of that at some point!).
