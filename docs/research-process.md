# Purpose

[ORGANISATION] has experience in performing a variety of research that targets various components within an enterprise setting. These experiences range from behavioural analysis design to target the human component of an organisation through to in depth reverse engineering designed to the tease critical software vulnerabilities out of a bespoke software stack.

# Process

Whilst research lifecycles vary depending on the whether the research process is deductive or inductive and whether the output is quantitative or qualitative, in general terms, the following phases will be performed:

## Phase 1: Identification of target

The purpose this phase is to identify the appropriate questions which it is hoped that the research will answer. From [ORGANISATION]’ perspective it is likely this will revolves around the confidentiality, integrity and availability triad and security claims that have been made about a given piece of software or hardware.

In some cases, the target and claims will have been selected by the researcher for curiosities sake however it is worth noting that for commercial work, this phase can and will be performed as part of the process of producing the initial scope. We fully appreciate however that many organisations may not wish to divulge full details until contracts for work have been fully agreed.

## Phase 2: Selection of methodology

Having identified the target and the associated security claims that the researcher will seek to validates, it is then necessary to select appropriate methodologies to support this process. In many cases, the researcher will be performing qualitative research on a software or hardware target and will therefore be able to leverage [ORGANISATION]’ existing technical assessment methodologies however soft and/or quantitative methodologies such as questionnaires will be utilised if appropriate.

## Phase 3: Development of research plan

Having identified the target and selected the appropriate methodologies, a plan will then be generated that documents the proposed target, specifies an intended research schedule (broken down into quarters) and an overall goal along with sub-goals for each quarter. The plan will also detail the proposed steps that the researcher will take in order to address each sub-goal along with the appropriate methodologies. This plan will form the basis of ongoing quarterly reviews.

## Phase 4: Ethics review

Given the nature of the work that [ORGANISATION] do, at this stage, an ethics review will be performed to ensure that the proposed research complies with our Ethical Policy and that it complies with any other legal frameworks that are effective within jurisdictions in which we operate.

## Phase 5: Review of previous subject sesearch

[ORGANISATION]’ believe that no serious research project can be delivered without a basic understanding of other research that has been previously performed on a given subject. This may include, but is not limited to:

* Research on other implementations of the same technology;
* Research of other versions of the same target.

In particular, this gives the researcher the opportunity to:

* Gain further familiarity with the target;
* Identify effective methodologies for assessment of the target which they might not otherwise have considered;
* Prove or disprove previous researcher derived security claims.

It also ensures a more robust research design which will be able to withstand challenges raised during the peer review process.

## Phase 6: Development of research design

Based on the previously documented research plan, the researcher will then construct a more detailed research design.

With regard to [ORGANISATION]’ existing technical assessment methodologies, this will largely consist of performing a review of the technical design and any associated network diagrams along with physical analysis of any black box devices that may be present in the solution. The purpose of this will be to identify the exposed attack surfaces. At a minimum, this review must identify:

* Physically exposed attack surfaces;
* Network exposed attack surfaces;
* Administratively exposed attack surfaces.

Where the intention is to utilise questionnaires or other soft and/or quantitative methodologies, it is at this stage that these will be fleshed out.

In either instance, the researcher will take care to ensure that the design allows the previously identified security claims regarding the target to be assessed.

## Phase 7: Data collection and analysis

Having performed a review of the attack surface, the target’s security claims can then be validated. As such, it may take the form of a blended assessment tailored to the specifics of the target that is being reviewed. Typically the following technical assessment methodologies are utilised:

* Telephony Assessment – to provide assurance that an organisations telephony system and any data it stores or transmits over the network is secured to prevent unauthorised access. This can involve assessing access via serial lines, traditional PSTN, ISDN and even GSM;
* Layer 2 Traffic Analysis Assessment – to provide assurance that any networks to which the RTUs, PLCs and outstations connect, store and transmit over the network in a secure fashion and prevent unauthorised access;
* Wireless Assessment – to provide assurance that it cannot be used to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of an organisations network or data;
* VPN Assessment – to provide assurance of the integrity and confidentiality of a network, implied by their presence and use. It is imperative that confidence in the security infrastructure is not impaired by an extension of the trust boundaries outside the organisation’s physical perimeter;
* Internal Host Assessment – to provide assurance that any services offered by the management hosts or network infrastructure (such as routers, switches etc), store and transmit over the network in a secure fashion and prevent unauthorised access and that no known vulnerabilities are present;
* Application Assessments – based on the above assessments, application layer testing will then be performed. This generally takes the form of analysing web or binary application protocols. It is not unheard of for binary applications to use proprietary protocols. Where necessary, fuzzing and reverse engineering will be utilised to enable the researcher to fully understand the applications and protocols and how they respond to exceptional, malformed input. Where web applications are encountered, the researcher’s standard web application methodology will be applied. It may also be necessary to perform assessments of any backend database systems (proprietary or off-the-shelf) at this stage;
* Build Review Assessment – to provide assurance that any hosts (for example running Windows XP embedded) are built in line with industry recognised good practice – CPNI Good Practice Guidance etc;
* Policy Assessment – to provide assurance that passwords, software patching, single sign on, PSTN/GSM modem configuration (telephone numbers allowed to dial in) etc are in line with industry good practice.

Where particular assurance regarding a specific is required, Code Review and even Denial of Service Assessments may also be utilised.

## Phase 8: Interpretation of results

The researcher will perform ongoing quarterly reviews of the results to establish whether the research design is effectively allowing the security claims identified during phase 1 to be validated.

Assuming the research design is effective, the data will be analysed and the security claims (treated as hypothesis) assessed.

Where quantitative data is available, for example as output from a questionnaire or the tracking of performance metrics, these will be analysed and the results assessed using standardised, well known data analysis techniques.

Details of the methods by which data, either quantitative or qualitative will be documented allowing future researchers to attempt to reproduce [ORGANISATION]’ results.

It is likely that the researcher will be perform phases 6, 7 and 8 in an iterative fashion. It is [ORGANISATION]’ experience that knowledge gained in one stage will inform and shape activities performed in the other.

## Phase 9: Peer review

All research results will be peer reviewed prior to delivery. Where [ORGANISATION] propose to publicly disclose research, an independent peer review may be sought to establish the veracity and scope of the researcher’s results.

# Deliverables

Typical deliverables for a research project will consist of a standard [ORGANISATION] report detailing the researcher's findings.
