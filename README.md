# Welcome

This project contains a generic copy of the resources historically used by Portcullis Computer Security to manage our Research Process prior to our acquisition by Cisco.

For background, our research process was managed by a dedicated research team who utilise an issue management system to track all of the research projects we carry out from inception through to publishing.

You can find further details about our processes in the docs subdirectory. The Research Policy is intended for public consumption whilst the Research Process is expected to have a primarily internal audience.

Portcullis published our research in two main forms, as conference presentations and as white papers,

Research was typically accompanied by a full disclosure of the technical findings on our web site at:

* https://www.portcullis-security.com/security-research-and-downloads/security-advisories/

Alternatively, blog posts may have been published covering less specific findings such as details on new tools and/or methodologies. For these, you may wish to visit the Portcullis Labs archive at:
